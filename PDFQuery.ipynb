Preamble:  \\n \\nAs per the Statutes, a number of Engineering Colleges have been granted the autonomous  \\nstatus . There is a need to derive full benefits of the academic autonomy accorded to the  \\ncollege  towards  addressing  the 21stcentury  challenges  faced  by the technical  education  \\nsystem  in the country, like:  4   \\n\\uf0b7 Ever  increasing  influence  of science  and technology  and their impact  on human  \\nsociety.  \\n\\uf0b7 Shrinking  time scale  of new developments  and the high rate of obsolescence  in the \\nolder  practices.  \\n\\uf0b7 Penetration  of Information  Technology  in all sectors  of human  activity  and economic  \\nDevelopment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Service  sector  becoming  a major  avenue  for employment  of technical  professionals  \\nand also for  economic  gains.  \\n\\uf0b7 Emergence of knowledge as a key driver for the progress of nations and for increasing  \\ntheir influence  on the  world scenario.  \\n \\nAs engineers have to convert these challenges into opportunities, it is expected that the 21st \\ncentury  engineers will be  required t o have:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Strong  foundation  in the basics  of mathematics,  science  and engineering  discipline.  \\n\\uf0b7 Command  over the chosen  area of technical  specialization.  \\n\\uf0b7 Capacity  to apply  the professional knowledge and  skills  acquired.  \\n\\uf0b7 Good  competence  to learn  a subject  on one’s own without  major  external  help.  \\n\\uf0b7 Expertise  in analysis,  design, modelling  and simulation  of complex systems.  \\n\\uf0b7 Scaling  up, mass  production,  system  operation  and maintenance.  \\n\\uf0b7 Estimation  of costs  and time factors  in an assignment.  \\n\\uf0b7 Ability  for rational,  logical, orderly  and objective  thinking.  \\n\\uf0b7 Skills  in personnel  management  and human  relations,  and \\n\\uf0b7 Leadership  qualities  including  spirit  of tolerance, patience and  team  work.  \\n \\nTherefore, Institute  make full  use of the academic freedom  given  to it by the Univer sity: \\n\\uf0b7 With  responsibility  and accountability  \\n\\uf0b7 Use the available opportunity to demonstrate its capabilities and innovative skills, to  \\nbecome  visible in the higher education system  and, \\n\\uf0b7 Gaining the confidence, gratitude and respect of all its stake holders, especially  \\nstudents,  alumni, parents and the  society  at large.  \\n \\nThese are particularly important for each Autonomous College as well as the University to be  \\nable to maintain and enhance their respective reputation, image and visibility in the technical  \\neducation  system as a  whole.  \\n \\n4. Academic  Programmes:  \\n \\n4.1 General:  \\n(a) Autonomy granted to the College is institutional in nature and hence the  Academic  \\nAutonomy is applicable for all programmes offered by the college i.e. B.E  at Undergraduate  \\n(UG), M. Tech., M.B.A and  M.C.A programmes at Postgraduate (PG) , M.Sc. (Engineering  \\nby research)  and the Ph.D  programme.  In all cases,  the programmes  shall  fulfil  the minimum  5  academic quality and standards for the award of Degrees prescribed by the University, the  \\nCouncil  and the  Commission.  \\n(b) The academic Autonomy provides an opportunity to the college to make schemes of  \\ninstruction, syllabi, scheme of examinations and other aspects, with approval of its Academic  \\nCouncil, while fulfilling the minimum academic standards of the Unive rsity for the Award of  \\nDegrees.  \\n(c) An Autonomous  college  shall  have  the freedom  to start Diploma  (post - polytechnic  \\nDiploma, post -UG and  post- PG levels) and/or Certificate programmes with the approval of  \\nits Academic  Council.  The issuance  of certificates/dip lomas  on completion  of such \\nprogrammes  shall be made  under the  seal of the  concerned College  only.  \\n(d) An Autonomous College shall also be free to evolve methods for assessing the students’  \\nperformance, notifying the results, issuing the grade cards/transcript s, migration and other  \\ncertificates  except the  Degree  Certificates.  \\n(e) In order to get the various benefits of academic autonomy, the College structures its  \\nvarious academic programmes based on the Semester Scheme by introducing Credits for  \\nacademic activitie s, bringing Examination Reforms for better achievement testing, awarding  \\nLetter Grades and Numerical Grade Points/ Averages for students’ performance and setting  \\nappropriate  Passing  Standards as covered later  in these  Regulations.  \\n(f) Following the guidelines recommended by the University, with respect to the Semester  \\nScheme, Credit System, Examinations, Letter Grades and Numerical Grade Points/Averages,  \\nenables the students to avail of horizontal/ vertical mobility and transfer of credits from one  \\nAutonomous  College  to another  and related benefits  of academic autonomy.  \\n \\n4.2 Nomenclatures  of Programmes:  \\n \\n(a) The College uses the nomenclature for their Degree programmes as specified by the UGC  \\nin its Notification dated 12th February, 2018 on \"Specification of Degrees 201 4\" as amended  \\nfrom time to time. Besides, the Degree Certificates issued by the University to their awardees  \\nshall  bear the name  of the concerned  Autonomous  College  as well.  This will help in \\nmaintaining the identity of each programme conducted at the Coll ege and also ensuring its  \\naccountability.  \\n(b) Therefore, the nomenclatures and their abbreviations given below, shall continue to be  \\nused for the Degree  programmes  offered by  the Institute  under  the University:  \\n \\n(i) UG Level : Bachelor  of Engineering  (B.E).  6  (ii) PG Level: Master  of Technology  (M. Tech.),  \\nMaster of Business Administration (M.B.A.)  \\nMaster  of Computer  Applications  (M.C.A.).  \\n \\n(iii) Research  Level:  M.Sc.  (Engineering)  by Research  \\nDoctor of  Philosophy  (Ph.D.).  \\n \\nBesides,  the branch,  the subject  of specialization,  if any, shall  be indicated  in brackets  after \\nthe abbreviation;  e.g., B.E. (Mechanical  Engineering),  M.Tech.  (Structural  Engineering).  \\n \\n4.3.

Programme  Duration  \\n \\n(a) The normal duration of fulltime academic p rogramme is the same as that followed by the  \\nUniversity, i.e., four years for B.E degree Program (Fulltime), three years for B.E. program  \\nunder lateral entry to second year, two years for M.Tech., M.B.A., and M.C.A., one year for  \\nDiploma and six months for  PG Certificate programmes. For research Programmes M.S. by  \\nresearch and Ph.D. as notified in University regulations and notification/directions issued  \\nfrom  time to time.  \\n(b) As a flexible  credit  system  is followed  for coursework,  it is to be noted  that the \\nprogramme duration in the case of UG and PG shall also be dictated by the period in which a  \\nstudent earns the prescribed credits for the award of Degree. Hence, it is possible for an  \\noutstanding  student  to earn the required  credits  in a shorter  time than that ordinarily  \\nprescribed  for the relevant programme  in (a) above.  \\n(c) The maximum  period  which  a student  can take to complete  a fulltime  academic  \\nprogramme shall be the same as that prescribed by the University from time to time; e.g.,  \\ndouble the normal duratio n of the programme, i.e., eight years for B.E. in case of fulltime  \\nProgram and six years in case of the B.E. Program under lateral entry to second year,  four \\nyears for M. Tech., M.B.A., and M.C.A., two year for Diploma and one year for Certificate  \\nProgramm e. Further, minimum and maximum period with respect to MS by research and  \\nPh.D.  shall  be as for Research  Programmes  M.S.  by research  and Ph.D.  as notified  in \\nUniversity  regulations.  \\n(d) Besides,  the maximum  period  for a programme  shall  also be dictated  by the fact that a 8  student has to demonstrate the specified minimum academic performance by registering for  \\nthe prescribed  minimum  number  of credits  in every  semester  for continuing  with the \\nprogramme. And, this period can be equal to or smaller than the maximum  period indicated  \\nas in (c) above.  \\n \\n4.5. Admission  of Students:  \\n(a) Admissions:  The admission  of students  to various  UG, PG and Research  Degree  \\nprogrammes  listed  under  Section  4.3, is governed  by the State  Government  and/or  the \\nUniversity  Policies/Practices  in this regard.  In particular,  the admission  of students  for \\nResearch Degree programmes at the College shall be made by the University by associating  \\nthe College concerned in the process as per the provisions in the VTU regulations governing  \\nthe Degree  of Ph.D.,  June 2017.  However,  the admission  of students  to Diploma  and \\nCertificate  programmes  shall  be made  by the College  on its own,  by following  the \\nRegulations  approved by its  Academic Council. In all the cases, it shall be necessary to  \\nfollow the statutory prov isions of reservation of seats to different categories of candidates  \\nfrom  time to time.  \\n(b) Lateral  Entry:  There  is a provision  for candidates  with a polytechnic  Diploma  or any \\nother  qualification  approved  by the Council  and the Commission  to join UG Degree  \\nprogrammes  at the beginning  of the second  year of the 4-year programme  as per the \\nprevailing practice in the University and asper the prevailing practice in the University.  \\n(c)Change  of Branch  / Specialisation  / College:  The UG students  can opt to migrate  from \\none branch  or specialization  to another  branch  or specialization  at the same  College  or at \\nanother Autonomous/ Affiliated/ Constituent College under the University at the beginning of  \\nthe second  year.  In these  cases,  the Colleges  follow  the Rules  and Regulations  of the \\nUniversity/Council.  \\n(d) Eligibility Criteria: The eligibility criteria / entry level qualification for admission of  \\nstudents to UG, PG, PG Diploma, PG Certificate, and Research Degree programmes at the  \\nAutonomous Colleges shall be the same as those prescribed by the University from time to  \\ntime. The Autonomous Institutes shall follow any other notification issued by the University  \\nin this regard from time to time.  \\n. \\n\\uf0b7 The eligibility  criteria  for admission  of students  from  a non-Autonomous  Colleg e to \\nan Autonomous  College,  from  one Autonomous  College  to another  Autonomous  \\nCollege  and from  University  scheme  at an Autonomous  College  to its Autonomous  9  scheme, shall be as per prevailing norms of the University. However, the Autonomous  \\nColleges  are free to provide  syllabus  equivalence  for such candidates  with the \\napproval  of it\\'s Academic  Council.  \\n\\uf0b7 The eligibility criteria for the admission of students from other Universities (India /  \\nAbroad)  to an Autonomous  College  shall  be as per the prevailing  norms  of the \\nUniversity.  However,  the Autonomous  Colleges  are free to provide  syllabus  \\nequivalence  with the  approval of it\\'s  Academic  Council.  \\n \\n4.6. Semester  Scheme:  \\na) Semester  Scheme:  The College adopts  the Semester  Scheme for  its UG Program  \\n \\nb) Academic Calendar:  There  is uniformity in the functioning of the Semester Scheme for  \\nall academic programmes across the College, as this can provide good academic flexibility to  \\ntheir stake holders, particularly the students and the faculty members. For this purpose, each  \\nacademi c year is divided into semesters, with the calendar, durations and academic activities  \\nbeing fixed in advance by the college while maintaining a common opening /reopening date  \\nfor the odd/even semester.  \\n \\nc) Academic  year  Breakdown:  The breakdown  of an academi c year for implementing  the \\nSemester  Scheme  at a College is  given  in Table 1 as a  typical example.  \\n \\nTable  4: Typical  Schedule  of Academic  Year  \\n \\nSl. \\nNo Activity  Description  \\n1 Number of  \\nSemesters/Year  Two regular semesters/year (ODD & EVEN)  \\nSupplementary/Fa st track  semester (after 2nd and 4th year)  \\n(Note: Supplementary/Fast  Track  Semester  is primarily  to assist  \\nthe slow  learners  and/or  repeater  students  for repeating  the \\ncourses.  However,  the College  uses this Semester  to arrange  \\nAdd-On Courses  for other  students and/or  for deputing  them  for \\nfield work  and/or  internship).  \\n2 Semester  Durations  \\n(Weeks)  Main  Semesters (Odd/Even):  19 weeks  each.  \\nSummer  Semester:  8 weeks  \\n3 Academic  Activities  \\n(Weeks)  Main  Semester:(Odd  /Even)  \\nRegistration of Courses - 0.5; Course Work - 15.5;  \\nExamination Preparation -1.0; Examinations - 1.0; \\nDeclaration  of Results - 1.0; Total:  19. \\nMake -up examination  and Recess:  2.0 weeks  \\nTotal duration of ODD and EVEN semester = 42 weeks  \\nSupplementary Semester  (For Repeat/Add -On Courses):  \\nRegistratio n of Courses - 0.1; Course  Work - 7.0; \\nExamination  Preparation -0.2; Examination -0.2; 10    Declaration  of Results -0.5; Total:  8. \\nMake -up examination and Recess: 2.0 weeks  \\nTotal  duration  of Summer  Semester  = 10 weeks  \\nNote: In each Semester, there shall be vario us provisions for students  \\nlike, Registration of Courses at the beginning, Dropping of Courses in  \\nthe middle and Withdrawal from Courses towards the end, all being  \\nunder the Faculty Members\\' advice. These facilities are required to  \\nensure  proper  monitoring  of students  by Faculty  Advisors,  leading  to \\ntheir improved learning capabilities and minimizing their chances of  \\nfailure  in the Courses  registered.  \\n4 Examinations  Continuous  Internal  Evaluation(CIE)  and Semester  End \\nExamination(SEE),  both having  equal  weightages  in the \\nstudents\\' performance in Course Work/Laboratory Work and  \\nother  activities . \\n5 Other  Items  \\uf0b7 The total number of academic days in an academic year  \\nshall  be >= 180.\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Academic schedules prescribed at each College shall be  \\nstrictly  adhered  to by it for success  of the Semester  \\nScheme.\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Supplementary Semester  shall be mainly used  by the  \\nColleges  for conducting repeat  Courses  for the  benefit  \\nof slow learners/ repeaters. \\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 UG Students  having  satisfactory  CIE and attendance  \\nbut, failed  (F grade)  in SEE,  need not register  for\\uf020\\ncourse/s  and can appear  for SEE as and when  \\nconducted.  \\n \\n5. Credit  System:  \\n \\n5.1. General:  \\n(a) The Institute has adopted the Choice Based Credit System (CBCS) for all the Programs.  \\nThe number of Contact Hours in a week of a particular course de termines its credit value.  \\nEach credit course shall be assigned appropriate number of credits, is  a measure of the  \\nweightage of the course. The students have an option of choosing from a wide range of  \\nelectives (Professional and Open) and complete the prog ramme at their own pace. Value  \\nadded courses are also offered as a part of extended learning in inter -disciplinary and multi - \\ndisciplinary domains. The CBCS for the various programmes provides a great opportunity to  \\nthe students in their  preparation to mee t the challenging  opportunities ahead.  \\n \\n(b) Major  Benefits: Major benefits  accruing  to the  College  by adopting  the Credit System  \\nare listed  below:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Quantification  and uniformity  in the listing  of courses  for all programmes  at a \\nCollege,  like core (hard/soft), electives  and project work.  11  \\uf0b7 Ease  of allocation  of courses  under  different  heads  by using  their credits  to meet  \\nnational  / international practices in technical education.  \\n\\uf0b7 Convenience  to specify  the minimum/  maximum  limits  of course  load and its average  \\nper semester in the  form  of credits to be earned by  a student.  \\n\\uf0b7 Flexibility  in programme  duration  for students  by enabling  them  to pace their course  \\nload within  minimum/maximum  limits  based  on their  preparation  and capabilities.  \\n\\uf0b7 Wider  choice  of courses  availab le from  any department  of the same  College  or even  \\nfrom  other similar  Colleges, either for  credit  or for audit . \\n\\uf0b7 Improved  facility  for students  to optimize  their learning  by availing  of transfer  of \\ncredits  earned by  them from  one College  to another.  \\n \\n \\n(c) Credi t System: In the Credit System, the course work of students is utilized and each unit  \\nis assigned  one credit after a student  completes the teaching -learning process as prescribed  \\nfor that unit and is successful in its assessment.  \\n \\n(d) Credit  Definition: One credit referring  to a Main  Semester  (Odd/Even)  course  shall  be \\nequal  to: \\n1. 1-hour Lecture  (L) per week  per semester =1  Credit  \\n2. 2 hours Tutorial  / (T)per week per  semester =  1 Credit  \\n3. 2 hours  Practical/Laboratory/  Drawing  (P) per week per  semester  = 1 Credit.  \\n4. Four -credit  theory  courses  shall  be designed  for 50 hours  of the Teaching -Learning  \\nprocess.  \\n5. Three -credit  theory  courses  shall  be designed  for 40 hours  of the Teaching -Learning  \\nprocess.  \\n6. Two-credit  theory  courses  shall  be designed  for 25 hours  of the Teaching -Learning  \\nprocess  \\n7. One credit  theory  course  shall  be designed  for 15 hours  of the Teaching -Learning  \\nprocess  \\n \\nThe following additional factors may  also be noted  in this connection:  \\n• The above figures shall be multiplied by a factor of 2 in the case of the Supple mentary  \\nSemester,  and \\n• Other student activities which are not demanding intellectually or which do not lend to  \\neffective assessment, like practical training, study tours, attending guest lectures shall  \\nnot carry  any credit.  \\n \\n(e) Course  Registration:  A student  shall register  for courses  (core  or elective)  to earn credits  \\nfor meeting  the requirements  of a Degree  programme.  Such courses  together with  their grades  12  and the credits earned shall be included in the Grade Card issued by the College at the end of  \\neach se mester, like odd, even, supplementary  and it forms the basis for determining the  \\nstudent’s  academic  performance  in that  semester.  \\n(f) Audit Courses: In Addition, a student can register for courses for audit only with a view  \\nto supplement his/her knowledge and/ or skills. Here also, the student’s grades will have to be  \\nreflected in the Grade Card.  But, these shall not be taken into account in determining the  \\nstudent’s  academic  performance  in the  semester.  \\n5.2 Credit  Structure:  A typical  Credit  Structure  for cours ework  based  on the above  \\ndefinition  is given  in Table  5. This shall  be applicable  for the coursework  of students  \\nregistered  for all UG, PG and Research  Programmes offered by  the institution.  \\nThus, it is more appropriate to specify the eligibility requireme nts for a Degree award based  \\non course work (like UG,) by prescribing the total number of credits to be earned, as an  \\nalternative to specifying the Programme Duration (as indicated in Section 4.4(a)).This will be  \\nof great  help in providing  the well-needed  flexibility  to the students  in planning  their \\nacademic  programmes and their  careers.  \\n \\nTable  5: Typical  Credit  Structure  for Course work  \\nCredit  Values  \\nTheory/Lectures  \\n(L)(hours/week  \\n/Semester)  Tutorials (T)  \\n(hours/week  \\n/Semester)  Laboratory/  \\nPractical  (P) \\n(hours/week  \\nSemester)  Credits  \\n(L:T:P)  Total  \\nCredits  \\n4 0 0 4:0:0  4 \\n3 0 2 3:0:1  4 \\n2 2 2 2:1:1  4 \\n3 0 0 3:0:0  3 \\n2 2 0 2:1:0  3 \\n2 0 2 2:0:1  3 \\n0 0 6 0:0:3  3 \\n2 0 0 2:0:0  2 \\n1 0 0 1:0:0  1 \\n0 2 0 0:1:0  1 \\n0 1 1 0:0.5:0.5  1 \\n0 0 2 0:0:1  1 \\nNOTE:  Activities  like practical  training,  study  tour, and participation  in Guest  \\nlecturers  do not car Credits.  \\n \\n \\n5.3. Course Load:  \\n(a) The course load for a student per semester (EVEN/ODD) as well as its minimum and  \\nmaximum  limits,  are based  on the guidelines  by the University , which  is based  on the 13  AICTE Model Curricula for UG Programmes(issued from time to time) and considering the  \\nacademic strength and capability of an average student, the course load/semester for UG  \\nProgramme  , \\n \\ni. For I and II semester,  the prescribed  course  load per semester  is fixed  at 20 \\ncredits/Semester  (common for  all the  UG Programs).  \\nii. In Higher  semesters  (FromIIIto  VIII),  the average  course  load is 22 credits  \\n/semester , with its minimum and maximum limits being set at 16 and 28 credits for \\nall UG  Progra ms including the credits of open electives. This flexibility enables  \\nstudents to cope -up with the course work and helps in improving their academic  \\nperformance and optimizes the learning  outcome.  \\niii. The minimum  course  load of any semester  shall  not be less than 16 credits  even  \\nafter dropping  a course(s)  or withdrawing  from  the registered  course(s).  \\n \\n5.4 Prescribed  Number  of Credits  for the Program  \\n(a) The total number  of credits  to be earned  by students  admitted  to the first \\nsemester  of 04  years  B.E./B.Tech., the prog ram shall  be 160. \\n(b) The total number  of credits  to be earned  by students  admitted  to the third  \\nsemester of 04 years B.E./B.Tech., program under lateral entry scheme shall be  \\n120. \\n(c) A student shall be eligible to obtain an Undergraduate degree with Honours /  \\nMinors , if he/she  earns  minimum  additional 18 credits,  as specified  by \\nuniversity/Institute  norms from time to time regarding the earning of additional  \\ncredits[To be read along with Regulations Governing the Award of Honors/  \\nMinors  in B.E./B.Tech.,  Degree  Programs].  \\n \\n5.5 Contact  Hours:  \\nConsidering the expectations from engineering professionals with UG Degrees in the 21st \\ncentury, the number of contact hours for students is fixed to 30 -35 hours/week. This will help  \\nstudents in getting enough time and opportunity t o do better preparation for the courses  \\nprescribed for credit, to take up self - study , to develop their creative talents and abilities and  \\nbenefitting from the Add -On courses and those taken for audit. This can also enable them to  \\nget ready  for challenging  and exciting  careers  ahead.  A typical  example  showing  the \\ncalculation  of contact hours based on course  credits is given  in Table  7. 14   \\nTable 7:  Calculation  of Contact  Hours/Week  – An Example  \\n \\nNo. of Courses  Credits  of the Course  Total  Credits  Contact  hours  per week  \\nThree  Lecture  Courses  3:0:0  9 9 \\nTwo Lecture  cum Tutorial  Courses  3:1:0  8 10 \\nTwo Lecture  cum Laboratory  \\nCourses  3:0:1  8 10 \\nOne Lecture,  Laboratory  cum \\nTutorial  Course  1:1:1  3 5 \\nTotal  28 34 \\n \\n5.6 Course  Registration  Details:  \\ni. Each  student  shall  have to register  for the prescribed  courses  of study  at the \\nbeginning  of the semester  subject  to course  load/  semester  requirement.  \\nii. The following category of students is required to re -register for the courses whenever  \\nthey are offered.  \\n\\uf0b7 Students  who have  failed to secure  the minimum  marks  in CIE (Continuous  Internal  \\nEvaluation)  and are under  NE (Not Satisfying  sessional  marks)  category.  \\n\\uf0b7 Students  who have  failed  to secure  the minimum  attendance  and are under  NE \\ncategory.  \\n\\uf0b7 Students  who have  withdrawn  a Course  and are under  Grade  W. \\n\\uf0b7 Students  who have  dropped  the courses.  \\n \\n5.7 Supplementary  Semester/Fast  Track  semester:  \\n \\na. The students  who have  satisfied  CIE and Attendance  requirements  for the course/s  \\nand obtained F grade in SEE are permitted to appear directly in ensuin g examination/s  \\nas backlog  paper/s.  The students  need  not re-register  for such course/s  in the \\nsupplementary/ fast track semester. In case the student wishes to improve CIE/ he/she  \\nhas to re-register for  supplementary  / fast track  semester as  and when  offered next.  \\nb. The student who obtains required attendance and CIE in supplementary semester, but  \\nobtains  F grade  in SEE,  is permitted  appear  for SEE subsequently  as backlog  \\ncourse/s.  The student need  not repeat course  for Attendance  and CIE.  \\nc. The course/s for w hich the student does not possess satisfactory attendance and CIE  \\nscore, shall be marked as NE in the Grade sheet. Such students are not permitted for  \\nSEE for the Courses  marked  as NE in Grade  sheet.  The students  have  to re-register  15  only for course/s mark ed as NE in supplementary/ subsequent semester whenever  \\nthat course is offered and obtain the required CIE and attendance . Subsequently,  \\nthey are eligible  to appear for SEE in such course/s.  \\nd. Courses with Transitional Grades Viz  \"W\" , \" I\", and \"X\" are also  eligible to register  \\nin supplementary semester (refer 8.2 (a) -(d) for definition of these grades) in case if  \\nthey wish to improve  the score  in CIE.  \\ne. All courses may not be offered in the Supplementary semester. It is the discretion of  \\nthe College to offer the courses based on the availability of resources. The Institutes  \\nshall  notify  time table for  Supplementary  semester well in  advance.  \\nf. Supplementary Semester is optional; it is for the student to make best use of the  \\nopportunity. Supplementary semester is a special semester and the student cannot  \\ndemand  it as a  matter  of right.  \\ng. A student is permitted to register for a maximum of 16 credits in Supplementary / fast  \\ntrack  semester.A  student  has to choose  those  courses  which  are offered  by the \\nInstitution in a given Supplementary Semester. In the supplementary semester, each  \\ncourse need to be offered for required number of lectures/ tutorial/ laboratory hours as  \\nprescribed  in the  syllabus.  \\n \\nh. Registration  for Summer/Fast  Track  semester:  \\nA student of UG programme will have opportunity to register for summer/fast track  \\nsemester which is offered after 4th semester for courses from 1 st to 4th semester and \\nafter  8th semester  for courses  from  5th to 8th semester . For registering  to for \\nsummer/fast track semester, the student should complete the Internship/s as notified  \\nin the University  Regulations  / directions.  The students  opting  for supplementary  \\nsemester between 4th and 5 th semester must comply the missed internship requirement  \\nin the subsequent  semester in the gap  between  5 th and 6th semester.  \\n \\n6. Curriculum  Framework  \\n \\n6.1 General  Issues:  \\n \\n(a) Curriculum  Framework  is important  in setting  the right  direction  for a Degree/  \\nDiploma/Certificate programme by the College, as it takes into account the type and  \\nquantum of knowledge necessary to be acquired by a student to qualify for a particular  \\ndegree  in his/her  chosen  branch or specialization area.  16  (b) Besides, this also helps in assigning the credits for each course, sequencing the courses  \\nsemester -wise and finally arriving at the t otal number of courses to be studied and the  \\ntotal number of credits to be earned by a student to fulfil the requirements for the  \\nconferment. The College also takes into account the AICTE Model Curricula notified  \\nfrom time to time and follow them so as to be abreast of the national trends in this  \\nconnection.  \\n \\n6.2. B.E. Degree  Programme:  \\nThe Curriculum  Framework  for a B.E. Degree  programme  shall  include  the following  \\nCourses.  \\n(a) Recommended  Courses: These  include coursework  under  the following  categories:  \\n \\nHumanit ies, Social Sciences, and Management Courses (HSMC)  \\nBasic  Science  Courses  (BSC)  \\nEngineering Science Courses (ESC)  \\nProfessional Core Courses (PCC)  \\nProfessional Elective Courses (PEC)  \\nOpen  Elective  Courses (OEC)  \\nIntegrated  Professional  Core  Courses  (IPC C) \\nProject Work: Mini -project work and Major Project work  \\nSeminar  \\nInternship  (INT)  \\nNon-Credit Mandatory Courses (NCMC)  \\nAbility Enhancement Courses(AEC)  \\nUniversal  Human  Values  Courses(UHV)  \\n \\n(b) Mandatory  courses  (MC)  and other  requirements : \\nThe UG student  shall complete the non -credit mandatory courses defined in the curricula. like  \\nEmployability skills, NSS, NCC, Sports, Yoga. Such courses shall not carry any credit for the  \\naward of the Degree. But, a pass in each such course during the programme shall be  a \\nnecessary  requirement  for the student  to qualify  for the Degree.  Hence,  the student’s  \\nperformance with respect to Mandatory Courses shall be included in the grade card as Pass  \\n(PP) /Not Pass(NP).  \\n \\n(c) Induction  Programme  and Internships:  \\n\\uf0b7 A three week Induct ion Programme is mandatory for the first -year B.E. students at the  \\nbeginning of their First Semester, as per the requirements of AICTE in its Model UG  \\nCurriculum (February  2018).  \\n\\uf0b7 Besides, there is also a mandatory requirement of Internships to be undertake n by all  \\nthe UG students as specified by  the University  from time  to time.  \\n(d) Classifications of Courses: The above courses shall be classified as:  \\n(i)Institutional  Courses -Credit  Courses  \\nBasic  Sciences,  Engineering  Core  Courses  and Humanities  & Social  Scien ce courses  are the \\n17  Institutional Courses. The student shall complete all the Institutional courses having credit  \\nweightage. The grades and credits earned by the candidate in the courses shall be included in  \\nthe grade  card.  \\n \\n(ii) Departmental  Core  Courses  –Cred it courses  \\nProfessional Core courses are Departmental Core Courses. The student shall complete all the  \\ndepartmental  core courses having credit weightage. The grades  & credits earned  by the  \\ncandidate  in the  courses shall be  included in the  grade  card.  \\n \\n(iii) Depa rtmental  and Inter -Departmental  Electives –Credit  Courses.  \\nProfessional Elective courses of parent and other departments are the Departmental &Inter - \\nDepartmental Electives. The student shall complete the prescribed number of departmental  \\nand inter departme ntal electives having credit weightage. The grades and credits earned by  \\nthe candidate  in the  course  shall  be included  in the  grade  card.  \\n \\n(iv) Mandatory  Courses –Non-Credit  Courses.  \\nThe student shall complete the non -credit mandatory courses defined in the curr icula. Such  \\ncourses shall not carry any credit for the award of the Degree. But, a pass in each such course  \\nduring the programme shall be a necessary requirement for the student to qualify for the  \\nDegree.  Hence,  the student’s  performance  with respect  to Mandatory  Courses  shall  be \\nincluded  in the  grade  card as Pass (PP) /Not Pass(NP).  \\n(v) Audit  courses –Non-Credit  Courses.  \\nA student  having  prerequisite  can register  to any course  under  (ii) and (iii) of ( 6 . 2 d) \\nwhenever  they are offered  with a view  to supplemen t his/her  knowledge  and/or  skills.  \\nRegistration for audit course(s) is permitted from III semester on wards.The audit course(s)  \\nhas to be completed as per the attendance and CIE norms for record of the audit course(s) in  \\nthe grade  card.  \\n(e) Allocation of Credi ts for B.E. Degree Programme: Looking at the UG Engineering  \\nDegree programmes practiced at leading institutions in India and abroad and the need for  \\nIndian engineering professionals to be able to meet the 21st century challenges, proposed  \\nbreakdown of cour sework is as given in Table 8. It is expected that this breakdown will lead  \\nto a highly  useful and respectable  B.E. Degree  programme  under  the Institution.  18  Table  8: Breakdown  for the B.EDegree  Curriculum  \\nSl.

Based  on this, \\na typical sequencing plan for coursework  by taking into account the provisions in the AICTE  \\nModel  Curriculum for B.E.  Degree programme is  given in Table  9. \\n \\nTable  9: A Typical  Sequencing  Plan for  the B.E Degree Curriculum  \\nSemesters  Course  Categories  \\nI-II \\uf0b7 HSMC,  BSC,  AEC,  and ESC,  Common  for all Programmes  as per \\nAICTE  Model Curriculum.  \\n\\uf0b7 MC and Mandatory  Induction  Programme  (3 weeks).  \\nIII-IV \\uf0b7 HSMC,  BSC,  AEC,  and ESC,  Common  for all Programmes  (to be \\ncontinued)  \\n\\uf0b7 IPCC,  INT \\n\\uf0b7 Also,  MC (to be  continued, if  required)  \\n\\uf0b7 PCC:  In two/three groups  (like Circuit,  Non-Circuit).  \\n\\uf0b7 Area -wise Orientation,  Add-On Courses.  19  V-VII \\uf0b7 PCC/PEC/OEC,  Core  and Electives.  \\n\\uf0b7 IPCC,  AEC, HSMC,  \\n\\uf0b7 Branch -wise Orientation,  Add-On Courses,  Seminar,  Internship.  \\nVIII \\uf0b7 PEC/OEC,  Electives,  Project  work(PROJ),  Dissertation.  \\n\\uf0b7 Add-On Courses,  Semina r, Final  wrap -up of Programme.  \\n \\n7. Assessment:  \\n7.1. Achievement  Testing:  \\na) The assessment of students\\' performance in course work during and/or at the conclusion of  \\na programme  has to be done  using  examinations.  In general,  an examination  addresses  \\ndifferen t objectives,  like achievement -testing,  prediction -testing,  endurance -testing,  \\ncreativity -testing  and testing  for ranking.  \\n(b) In technical education, the assessment has to be preferably of the achievement - testing  \\ntype, so that a student\\'s knowledge, understa nding and competence in the courses studied are  \\nproperly assessed and certified. The reforms in the examination system given below enables  \\nthe College to achieve this goal and gain the confidence and respect of thestake holders,  \\nparticularly students. Typi cally, achievement - testing is done in two parts as follows, both of  \\nthem  being  important in  assessing  a student\\'s achievement:  \\n\\uf0b7 Sessional: Involving Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE),to be conducted by the  \\ncourse instructor all through the semester. Thi s includes mid -term tests, homework  \\nassignments,  problem  solving,  group  discussions,  quiz,  seminar,  mini-project  and \\nother  means.  \\n\\uf0b7 Terminal, covering Semester End Examinations (SEE),to be conducted by the course  \\ninstructor jointly with an external examiner at the end of a semester, on dates to be  \\nfixed at the College level. This may include a written examination for theory courses  \\nand practical/design  examination  with built-in oral part for laboratory/design  courses.  \\n(c) The Students are assessed through Continu ous Internal Evaluation(CIE) and Semester  \\nEnd Examination(SEE).  Both  CIE and SEE being  equally  important  in judging  the \\ncoursework performance of students, they need to be conducted with equal rigour and equal  \\nseriousness in the credit system. This makes i t necessary that both of them are assigned  \\nequal (50:50) weightage . And, a student\\'s performance in coursework shall be judged by  \\ntaking into account the results of both CIE and SEE individually and also together by giving  \\nequal weightage  for them.  20  7.2 Question  Papers Guidelines:  \\n \\n(a) Question Paper Pattern: For an effective achievement testing of students in a course, a  \\ngood question paper needs to be used as the principal tool. This makes it necessary for the  \\nquestion  papers used  at CIE  and SEE to;  \\n\\uf0b7 Cover  all sections  of the course  syllabus  uniformly.  \\n\\uf0b7 Be unambiguous and  free from  any defects/errors.  \\n\\uf0b7 Emphasize  knowledge  testing, problem  solving  and quantitative  methods.  \\n\\uf0b7 Contain  adequate  data/  other  information  on the problems  assigned, and  \\n\\uf0b7 Have  clear and  comple te instructions  to the candidates.  \\n \\n(b) Question  Paper  Planning: The above  requirements  make  it necessary  for a Question  \\nPaper to cover the entire syllabus, with a provision for the students to answer questions from  \\nthe whole syllabus. As students need to be gi ven some choice in the questions included in the  \\nPaper, it is necessary for the Question Papers at SEE, in particular, to have built in choice  \\nunder  each modulesof the  syllabus.  \\n \\n(c) Besides, it is also necessary for the Course syllabi to be drafted properly, be defect -free \\nand also properly given  in modular  form to  enable the  setting of  good question papers  \\ncovering the whole syllabus. These aspects have to be taken into account, in particular, by the  \\nBoards  of Studies.  \\n \\n(d) Typical  Question  Paper: The questions  to be included  in the Question  Papers  at \\nContinuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) and SemesterEndExamination ( SEE) can be of  \\ntwo types as follows and the course instructors as well as the external examiners shall have to  \\nbe well trained/experienced to set them.  \\n\\uf0b7 Multiple Choice Question, having each question to be answered by tick marking the  \\ncorrect answer from the choices (commonly four) given against it. Such a question  \\npaper to be useful in the testing of knowledge, skills, comprehension, application,  \\nanalysis , synthesis, evaluation and understanding of the students. However, Question  \\nPapers  for CIE and SEE  to include  not more  than 15-20% of questions  of this  type.  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Comprehensive Questions, having all questions of the regular type to be answered in  \\ndetail. Such  a Question Paper to be useful in the testing of overall achievement and  \\nmaturity  of the students  in a course  through  long questions  relating  to 21  theoretical/practical knowledge, derivations, problem solving, modeling, simulation,  \\ndesign,  application and q uantitative evaluation.  \\n \\n \\n7.3. Examinations:  \\n(a) Maintenance of Standards: For ensuring a high standard in both CIE and SEE fully  \\nmeeting the provisions of the University Statutes and being able to declare the results of  \\nstudents’  performance at  both these  in a time bound  manner  as per theAcademic  Calendars.  \\n \\ni. Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE): The CIE shall be conducted exclusively by  \\nthe course instructor. The instructor to spell out the components of CIE to the students  \\nin advance, maintain transparency in  its operation, declare the evaluation results in  \\ntime and then return the answer scripts and assignment sheets to them as soon as  \\npossible. The instructor shall also solve the questions from these test papers during  \\ntutorial  sessions  for the benefit  of all the students  concerned,  especially  slow learners.  \\n \\nii. Semester  End Examination  (SEE):  \\nThe SEE shall be conducted jointly by the course instructor and an external examiner  \\nappointed for this purpose by the College. Here, the external examiner is to mainly  \\nassociate with the work of Question Paper setting, because of the difficulties in having  \\nhim/her for conducting the evaluation of students’ answer scripts due to the tight time  \\nschedule for the various tasks connected with SEE, as covered in sub -sections (i)  \\nand(ii)  below.  \\n \\niii. SEE Answer Scripts: The answer scripts of SEE may be normally evaluated by the  \\ncourse instructor only. But as a healthy step, an Examination Committee shall oversee  \\nthis task and ensure the quality and standard of evaluation and also of th e grades  \\nawarded in all the cases. The next step to be taken before declaring the results, to  \\ninclude  an external review of  the SEE conducted.  \\n \\niv. External  Review  of SEE:  An external  review  shall  be conducted  under  the aegis  of \\nthe Board of Studies/Board of E xaminers of the College by appointing a panel of  \\nexperts from outside the College for this purpose aiming at a complete review of SEE  \\noperation in the College. This may include such steps as, question paper review, checking  \\nrandom  samples  of answer  scripts,  analysis  of results/grades  awarded  and other  related  22  aspects. This step to be also necessary for gaining the confidence of the University and of  \\nthe society at large, on the fairness, transparency and acceptability of the examination  \\npractice  among  the stakeholders.  \\n \\n(b) Attendance  Standards:  \\ni. All students shall maintain a minimum attendance of 85% in each Course registered.  \\nIn case of short fall of attendance, the Principal of the Institute can condone the  \\ndeficiency upto10% on the prescribed limit of 85% in special cases like medical  \\nexigencies,  participation  with permission  in University/State/National/International  \\nsports meets, cultural events, etc.He/She has to produce authentic documents through  \\nthe Mentor and HODs recommendations. Even in such cases, a minimum of 75%  \\nattendance  is absolutely mandatory . \\nii. The basis for the computation of the attendance shall be the period prescribed by the  \\nCollege by its calendar of events. For the first semester students, the same is reckoned  \\nfrom  the Date of Admission to t he Course.  \\niii. The students  shall  take note of his/her  attendance  status  periodically  from  the \\nrespective faculty and strive to make up for the shortage. The Departments shall  \\nperiodically  announce  the attendance  status  of the students.  Non-receipt  of such \\ninformation from the College, the student shall not consider it as a valid reason for  \\nexemption  from the  attendance requirements.  \\niv. If a student does not satisfy the attendance requirements in any Course, then he / she  \\nshall not be permitted to attend the SEE i n that Course and is deemed to have been  \\ndeclared “NE” (Not satisfactory) in that Course. In such a case, student has to Re- \\nRegister  for the course  whenever  it is offered  (regular/Summer  semester).  \\n \\nv. Leave  Facility  during  an odd/even  semester  \\n\\uf0b7 A student mus t obtain prior permission from the concerned course teacher, Mentor  \\nand Head of the Department(HOD )in advance, when the absence is expected to be  \\nmore than two consecutive days. The application for leave of absence must be made  \\nin writing to the HOD with the recommendation of the Mentor. The student will have  \\nto furnish the  supporting  documents  either before  or after the absence.  \\n\\uf0b7 In case the application cannot be made in advance for grant of leave, the same must  \\nbe made  immediately  after returning  from  the absence,  along  with necessary  \\ndocuments.  23  \\uf0b7 Failure  to apply  in writing  before  proceeding  on leave  or within  are reasonable  period  \\nof time after returning from leave may lead to the absence being considered as casual  \\nabsence. The above requirements also app ly to students representing the institute in  \\nUniversity/State/National/International  sports  meets,  cultural  events,  etc. \\n\\uf0b7 The permitted leave of absence will be considered for attendance condonation to an  \\nextent of10% only. Hence the above relaxation is onl y to those students having  \\nattendance  in the range  of 75%to 85%.  \\n \\n(c) Passing  Standards:  \\nTo maintain high academic standards, the Institute has adopted the eligibility criterion for  \\nCIE and SEE as shown in  Table  10 for UG Programmes.  \\n \\nTable  10: Passing  Standar ds using  Absolute  Grading  \\nEvaluation  Method  Passing  Standard  \\nSessional  (Continuous  Internal  \\nEvaluation)  Score:  ≥ 40% \\nTerminal  (Semester  End \\nExamination)  Score:  ≥ 35% \\nOverall  Score  for passing (CIE+SEE)  is 40% \\n \\nIn the case of all the courses of the program, the maximum CIE marks shall be 50 and the  \\nmaximum  SEE marks  shall  be 50. The minimum  CIE marks  secured  shall be 40%  of \\nmaximum marks, i.e. 20 out of 50 marks for passing. The minimum SEE marks to be secured  \\nshall be 35 %  of the maximum marks i.e., 18  out of 50  marks  for passing.  In total, the  \\nstudent has to secure 40 % of the course maximum marks i.e., the sum of the CIE and SEE  \\nmarks  prescribed for  the Course.  \\n \\n(d) Project  work  evaluation:  The evaluation  of CIE of the project  work  shall  be based  on the \\nprogress of the student in the work assigned by the project supervisor periodically evaluated  \\nby him/her together with a Departmental Committee constituted for this purpose at each  \\nAutonomous  College.  Seminar  presentation,  project  report(dissertation)  and final oral \\nexamination conducted by a common Project Evaluation Committee at the College level shall  \\nform  the SEE of the project work.  \\n \\n(e) In the case of other requirements, such as seminar, industrial internship, field work,  \\ncomprehensive viva voce, if any, the assessment shall be made as laid down by the Academic  \\nCouncil  of the  College.  24  (f) There  shall  be no re-examinatio n for any Course  in the credit  system  to take care of \\nsuch students:  \\ni. Who  have  absented themselves  from attending  CIE or SEE without  any valid reason;  \\nii. Who  have  failed  (Grade  F) to meet  the minimum  passing  Standard  prescribed  for CIE \\nand/or SEE;  \\niii. Who  have  been detained  for shortage  of attendance  in any  coursework;  \\niv. Who  have  withdrawn  (Grade  W, as  covered  in Section 8.)  from  a Course.  \\n \\nSuch students shall be required to re -register for the Course(s) and go through CIE and SEE  \\nagain and obtain a Grade P or better  (see Tables 17) in each case. The re -registration shall be  \\npossible only when the particular Course is offered again either in a main (Odd/Even) or a  \\nsummer  semester.  \\n(d)Successive  Failures:  \\nIf a student fails to pass a Course even after four attempts, th at course is deemed to be  \\nexempted for him/her. Then, the student may choose a course of his / her choice with the  \\nsame number of credits  from the pool of courses stipulated by the concerned  Board of  \\nStudies.  The course  so selected  should  not have  been  studied by the student  or to be studied  \\nin higher semester/s. The faculty advisor shall guide/advise the student in this regard. The  \\ncollege has to make arrangements for the registration, conduction of CIE for the selected  \\ncourse.  This prevision  is given  only for two courses  (one at a time)  during  the entire  \\nmaximum duration of a course. However, this is optional and the student can prefer to repeat  \\nthe same course  in which  he/she  has failed  repeatedly.  \\n \\n8. Grading:  \\n8.1 General:  \\n(a) In recent  years, the grading system ha s replaced the evaluation of students’ performance  \\nin a Course  based  on absolute  marks,  because  of its many  advantages.  Therefore,  \\nAutonomous  Colleges  under  the University  shall  follow  this practice.  Here  again,  it is \\nnecessary to maintain uniformity in th e grading practices at different Colleges to ensure that  \\nthe migration  of students  or transfer  of credits  among  Autonomous  Colleges  under  the \\nUniversity  is made  easy.  \\n \\n(b) Letter Grades: Course Letter Grade (or simply letter grade or grade) is an index of  \\nperformance  of a student  in a said course  and refers  to a qualitative  measure  of achievement  \\nof a student in each course, based on the percentage range of marks secured in CIE and SEE  \\nput together or CIE alone. Grades are denoted by letters O, A+, A, B+, B, C,  P and F . The  \\nrubrics  attached to letter  grades are  as follows:  \\nO - Outstanding, A+  - Excellent,  A - Very  Good,  B+ - Good, B  - Above Average,  25  C - Average, P - Pass and F - Fail. If student remain absent for SEE of any of the course,  \\nthe letter  grade  assign ed to that course  shall  be ‘F’. \\n \\nNot Eligible (NE): If a student fails to satisfy Attendance and / or CIE requirement for  \\ncourse/s then such course/s shall be marked as Not Eligible “(NE) \" i.e. Not eligible to appear  \\nfor SEE in that Courses/s.  \\n \\n(c) Absolute Gr ading: Dr Ambedkar Institute of Technology adopts the absolute grading  \\nsystem.  \\n \\n8.2 Grade  Points:  \\n(a) Depending on the letter grades assigned, a student earns certain grade points. As the  \\ngrading system can have different scales for  grade points (like 5, 8, 10.) The institute  \\nfollows a 10 -pointscale. The total marks scored by the students in CIE and SEE shall be  \\nconverted  into letter  (an Alphabet)  grades  O, A+, A, B+, B, C, P, E and F. Each  letter  grade  \\nis basically  a qualitative  measure  of performance  of a student . The equivalence  of letter  \\ngrade  interms  of grade  points  and examination  marks  range  is ass hown  in Table .11. \\n \\nTable 11:  Grade  Points  Scales  for Absolute  Grading  \\n \\nLetter  Grade  O A+ A B+ B C P F \\nOutstand  \\ning Excellent  Very  \\nGood  Good  Above  \\nAverage  Average  Pass  Fail \\nGrade  \\nPoints  10 9 8 7 6 5 4 0 \\nScore  \\n(Marks)  \\nRange  % 90-100 80-89 70 -79 60 -69 55-59 50 − 54 40-49 0-39 \\n \\n(b) The grade points given in Table 11 will help in the evaluation of credit points earned by  \\nthe student in a Course as the credit points are equal to the number of credits assigned to the  \\nCourse multiplied by the grade points awarded to the student in that Course. This shall be  \\nused in arriving at the credit index of the student for that semester, as it is the sum total of all  \\nthe credit poin ts earned by  the student  for all the  Courses registered  in that  semester.  \\n(c) Earning  of Credits:  A student  shall  be considered  to have  completed  a Course  \\nsuccessfully  and earned  credits  if he/she  secures  an acceptable  letter  grade  in the range  O to \\nP. Letter  grade  ‘F’ in any Course  implies  failure  of the student  in that Course  and no credit  \\nshall  be earned.  \\n(d) Transitional Grades: The transitional grades, such as, \\'I\\', ‘W\\' and \\'X\\' shall be awarded  \\nto a student  in the following cases.  These  grades  need  to be conve rted into one or  the other of  26  the letter grades (O-F) after the student completes his/her Course requirements, including the  \\nexaminations.  \\ni) Grade \\'I\\': Awarded to a student having satisfactory attendance at classes and meeting the  \\npassing standard at CIE in  a Course, but remained absent from SEE for valid and convincing  \\nreasons  acceptable to the  College, like:  \\n\\uf0b7 Illness  or accident,  which  disabled  him/her  from  attending  SEE;  \\n\\uf0b7 A calamity  in the family  at the time of SEE,  which  constrains  the student  to be away  \\nfrom the Institute;  \\n\\uf0b7 Any other  emergency  certified  by the competent  authority.  \\n \\nIn the event of above, it is the responsibility of the student/Parent/Guardian to inform the  \\ncollege  authorities  [(Mentor/HoD]  immediately . The information  shall  be in the form  of either  \\nwritten communication, personal communication by Parent/Guardian/Peer or any Electronic  \\nmessages. The student needs to submit all the relevant documents(hospital reports, certificate  \\nfrom  competent  authorities  etc) \\n(ii) Grade\\'X\\': A student,who has sati sfied attendance requirements and has CIE marks (≥90)  \\nin any course , but earned  F grade  in SEE, shall  be awarded  grade‘ X’. \\n(iii) Grade  ‘W\\': Awarded  to a student  having  satisfactory  attendance  at classes,  but \\nwithdrawing  from that Course  before  the prescribed  date in a  semester  as per faculty  advice.  \\n \\n(e) Make -up Examination:  The Make -up Examination  facility shall  be available  to the \\nstudents who may have missed to attend the SEE of one or more Courses in a semester for  \\nvalid  reasons  and given  the \\'I\\' grade.  Students  having  the \\'X\\' grade  shall  also be eligible  to \\ntake advantage of this facility. The  Make -up Examination shall be held as per dates notified  \\nby Controller  of Examination,  immediately  after the announcement  of Semester  end \\nexaminations  (both regular and summer  semesters) results.  \\nIn all these cases, the st andard of the Make -up Examination shall be the same as that of the  \\nregular  SEE for the  Courses.  \\n(f) All the \\'I\\' and \\'X\\' grades awarded to the students shall have to be converted into one of the  \\nletter grades based on the performance in the makeup examination. In case the student fails to  \\nregister in the immediate makeup examination or fails to appear for th makeup examination,  \\nthen F grade  shall  be awarded to the  student in  that course.  \\n(g) All the \\'W\\' grades awarded to the students shall be eligible for conversion  to the  \\nappropriate letter grades only after the concerned students re -register for these Courses in a  \\nmain( Odd/Even) /supplementary semester and fulfil the passing standards for their class  \\nattendance,  CIE and SEE  as prescribed  at the  College.  27  (h) Grade Card:  Each student shall be issued a Grade Card (or transcript) at the end of each  \\nsemester. While this will have a list of all the Courses registered by a student in the semester  \\ntogether with their credits, the letter grades with grade points awarded in each case and those  \\nwith grades ‘I’, ‘W’ and ‘X’ , only those Courses registered for credit and having grade points  \\nshall be included in the computation of the student\\'s performance, like  SGPA and CGPA.  \\nAnd, the Courses taken for audit will not form part of this  computation. The results of  \\nmandatory courses , which are of the  non-credit type, shall also be reflected in the  Grade  \\nCard as PP (for Passed) or NP (for Not Passed). It shall be noted that each UG student shall  \\nhave to obtain the grade PP in each mandator y course to qualify for the Degree award by the  \\nUniversity  \\n \\n8.3 Grade  Point  Averages:  \\n \\n(a) SGPA and CGPA : The credit index can be used further for calculating the Semester Grade  \\nPoint Average (SGPA) and the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), both being importa nt \\nacademic performance indices of the student. While SGPA is equal to the credit index for a  \\nsemester divided by the total number of credits registered by the student in that semester, CGPA  \\ngives the sum total of credit indices of all the previous semeste rs divided by the total number of  \\ncredits registered in all these semesters. Both theequations together facilitate the declaration of  \\nacademic  performance  of a student, at  the end of a semester and at  the end  of successive  \\nsemesters  respectively. Thus,  \\n \\n(i) Semester Grade  Point Average  (SGPA):  \\nSGPAisequaltothecreditindexforasemesterdividedbythetotalnumberof  credits  registered  by the \\nstudent  in that semester.  \\n \\nSGPA=  ∑ [(𝑪𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆 𝑪𝒓𝒆𝒅𝒊𝒕𝒔)×(𝑮𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒔𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒓𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝑪𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆𝒔 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆𝒔 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝑺 𝒕𝒐 𝑭)] \\n∑(𝑪𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆 𝒄𝒓𝒆𝒅𝒊𝒕𝒔 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒓𝒆𝒈𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝑪𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆𝒔 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝒍𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒈𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒆𝒔 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝑺 𝒕𝒐 𝑭) \\n \\n(ii) Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA): CGPA gives the sum total of credit indices  \\nof all the previous semesters divided by the total number of credits registered in all these  \\nsemesters.  \\n \\n28  The SGPA  AND  CGPA  shall be rounded  off to  2 decimal  points and  reported  in grade  cards.  \\n \\n(b) Vertical  Progression :The criteria  for Vertical  Progression  is based  on University  \\nguidelines. Hence to lay down uniform minimum standards for CGPA together with the  \\nminimum number of credit s to be earned in an academic year  so as  to facilitate the mobility  \\nof students from one College to another.  All the below clauses are subject to a maximum  \\nduration  of eight  (for Regular Students)  / six years  (for Lateral  Entry  Students)  as applicable.  \\nIn case of students  admitted to  the first year:  \\ni. Students have to fulfill the attendance and CIE requirement to appear for SEE of  \\ncourse/s  of 1st year . \\nii. Students  having  not more  than four F grades  in the 1st and 2nd semesters  of the \\nfirst year of the program s hall be eligible to move to the 3 rd semester (2 nd year) of  \\nthe program.  These  courses include  courses marked as NE  . \\niii. The students who fail to satisfy CIE and attendance requirement has to repeat the  \\ncourses  whenever offered  next and become  eligible  for the 2nd year.  \\niv. Obtaining CIE: From the (3 rd semester) second year onwards the student who  \\nobtains the required attendance for the course, but not the required CIE marks is  \\nallowed  to move  forward  to the next semester.  However,  the student  has to \\nmandatorily  obtain the required  CIE in the subsequent  semester.  Obtaining  \\nminimum CIE marks for the course is mandatory. It may also be noted that the  \\nstudent  shall  not be permitted  to appear  for SEE in such courses until he/she  \\nobtains  the required CIE.  \\nv. Carryover of ba cklog courses: From 3 rd semester onwards the student/s who  \\nobtains required attendance, CIE, and appears for examinations but fails (F Grade)  \\nto pass a course/s is allowed to move forward to  the next semester  (odd /even)  \\nirrespective  of a number  of F grade s. However, for the award of degree, the  \\nstudent has to pass in all courses as per applicable scheme and regulations and earn  \\nthe prescribed  credits.  This is subject  to a permitted  maximum  duration.  It may \\nalso be noted  that the student will be given admis sion to the IV year (7th \\nsemester/8 th semester)  provided  he/she  passes  all courses  of 1st and 2nd \\nsemesters.  \\nvi. From the second year onwards there shall be no restriction from promotion from an  \\neven  to next odd semester  (or odd to next even  semester)  even  if the student  has not 29  satisfied the attendance requirementin one or more courses (including bridge courses  \\nfor lateral  entry  students)  shall  not be eligible  to appear  for the Semester  End \\nExamination (SEE) of that course(s). The student shall be required to  repeat that  \\ncoursewhenever offered  next.  \\nvii. Permitted Maximum credits for registration: The student shall be permitted to register  \\nfor total courses not exceeding 28 credits. These 28 credits include the courses of the  \\nregular semester and backlogs. The regi stration of these additional credits includes  \\nthe courses having a shortage of attendance and the courses whose CIE requirements  \\nare not fulfilled. A student has to pay the prescribed fee as notified by the University  \\nfrom  time to time.  \\nMaintain  > = 5.00 CGPA  before  the award  of B.E. degree;  \\ni. Degree  should  be completed  by 8 years (regular)  or 6 years (for  diploma);  \\n \\n(b) Award of Class: Sometimes, it is necessary to provide equivalence of these averages,  \\nviz., SGPA  and CGPA  with the percentages  and/or  Class  award ed as in the \\nconventional system of declaring the results of University examinations. This shall be  \\ndone by Autonomous Colleges under the University only at one stage by prescribing  \\ncertain specific thresholds in these averages for First Class with Distinc tion, First  \\nClass and Second Class, at the time of Degree Award. This provision given in Table  \\n12 follows  the approach  of the Council  for this purpose  as reproduced  from  the \\nAICTE Approval Process Handbook.  \\n(c) Conversions  of CGPA  into Percentage  of marks  and Class  Equivalence:  \\nThere is no formula for the conversion of CGPA into the percentage ofmarks. However,  \\nthe following  formula  for conversion  of the CGPA  on a 10- point  scale  into the \\npercentage  of marks  (M) for employment  / higherstudies, etc  may be used;  \\nPercentage  of marks  secured,  M = CGPA  Earned  x 10 \\nIllustration  for a CGPA of  8.20;  \\nPercentage  of marks  secured M =  8.20×  10 = 82.0 % \\n \\n(d) Class  equivalence : Subsequent  to the conversion  of final CGPA,  after successful  \\ncompletion  of the Program,  into the percen tage of marks  (M), a  graduating student  is \\nreckoned  to have  passed  in, \\n(i) First Class with  Distinction (FCD)  if M  ≥ 70 \\n(ii) First Class (FC) if  60 ≤ M ≥ 70  \\n(iii)Second  Class  (SC)  if 50 ≤ M ≥60 \\n(iv) Pass Class  (P) if  40 ≤ M  ≥50 30  8.4 Gracing  Policy:  \\n\\uf0b7 Grace marks shall be awarded to a Subject/Paper/Practical/ Head of passing to a  \\nmaximum of 2% of Semester End Examination (SEE) mar ks if, after gracing the  \\ncandidate gets minimum prescribed marks in the Theory/Practical and passes in the  \\nsubject.\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 A candidate shall be eligible to a maximum of 5 grace marks, provided He/She has  \\nfailed in only one subject (Pr/Th/Head of  Passing) of the e xamination passes the  \\nwhole examination by such gracing Gets minimum prescribed marks in the paper/  \\npractical  and aggregate  for passing  by such gracing.\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Above  is also applicable  to the candidates  who have  cleared  all courses  in the \\nprogramme  but failed in  one course which  deny  the award of  degree.\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Grace Marks shall be awarded for declaration of classes also. For obtaining a higher  \\nclass a candidate is eligible for getting a maximum of 5 grace marks, which will be  \\nadded to the total aggregate marks of the ca ndidate and will declare the candidate to  \\nhave  passed the  examination in  I Class of  FWD.\\uf020\\n\\uf0b7 Grace marks (GMR) awarded as per GMR 01 for passing a subject and GMR 02 for  \\npassing  the whole  examination  are shown  only in the ledger  and not in the statement  \\nof marks. A candidate  is entitled  for grace  marks  only under  any one of the \\nregulations either as per GMR01 or GMR 02 or GMR 03 A candidate is entitled for grace  \\nmarks  of 5 for the award of  class  of the degree. \\uf020\\n \\n9. Other  Academic  Matters:  \\n9.1 Choice  Based  Credit  System : \\n(a) It is necessary to implement a  Choice Based Credit System  for academic programmes at  \\nall the Autonomous Colleges under the University. This will be of considerable benefit to the  \\nstudents  for customizing  their programmes  of direct  interest  to them,  devel oping  their \\nindividual  capabilities  and talents  and preparing  them  for exciting  careers  ahead  in the \\n21stcentury.  \\n(b) This makes it  necessary  for the Autonomous  Colleges to  provide  for: \\n(i) Easy access to the Schemes of Instruction, Syllabi, Credit Structure of pr ogrammesand the  \\nCourses being conducted by all students (either in print or in electronic form) so as to assist  \\nthem  in course  work planning.  31  (ii) Institutionalizing the conduct of course work by adopting a centralized time table for all  \\nthe programmes  at a College,  with a view  to assist  the students  in customizing  their \\nprogrammes  and also optimizing  the use of physical facilities.  \\n(iii) Establishing a dynamic Faculty Advisory System at each College with 5 -10 students  \\nassigned  to an Advisor,  for guiding  them in  planning/implementing  their course  work  in a \\nflexible  and effective  manner and also monitoring them.  \\n \\n9.2. Change  of Branch:  \\nStudents  can apply  for change  of branch  in accordance  with the provisions  laid down  by \\nthe Institute,  University,  Council  and Government  of Karnataka.  Change  of branch  is \\nconsidered  in the  following  cases;  \\n\\uf0b7 Change  of branch  is considered  at the beginning  of III Semester  only.  \\n\\uf0b7 Only  those  students  who have  earned  all the 40 credits  of I/II semesters  are eligible  \\nfor the change  of branch.  \\n \\n \\n9.3.
